finding_sourceProperties_Explanation,"The local_infile flag controls the server-side LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA statements. Depending on the local_infile setting, the server refuses or permits local data loading by clients that have LOCAL enabled on the client side. Due to security issues associated with the local_infile flag, it is recommended to disable it."
