Programming with AMI
--------------------

AMI is a language designed to describe actions calling handlers with a set of functions
and variables.

Actions handlers can consume or create variables to be used by others after them.

Let's dive in the syntax now:

```
ami_version 1

action HelloWorld {
       $var = "Hello, world!"
       exec MyHandler
}
```

This example starts setting the mandatory ami_version, which must be 1 for now. Then
provides an action called "HelloWorld" which should execute a handler "MyHandler" with
the famous "Hello, world!" set to the $var variable.

Since Actions can be repeated, this example shows an action repeated 5 times:

```
ami_version 1

repeat 5 as $index {
       action HelloWorld {
       	      $var = "Hello, world!"
	      exec MyHandler
       }
}
```

The repeat keyword is self-explainatory, followed by the number of times it should
repeat, and defining a variable $index to hold the repeat iteration counter. It
can be used later to read a CSV sequentially etc.
